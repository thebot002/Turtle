# Turtle
Bachelor Open Day programming exercise - Linux version

## How to use:

Keep the master files on a usb stick (or else) and run "install.sh" in order to generate the exercise folder on the desktop of the computer.

After every session, re-run install to overwrite files that have been worked on.

## Solution:

- Angles for the triangle 60° but have to TURN 120° (180 - 60)
- Angles for the star 36° but have to TURN 144° (180 - 36). Development:
    - Pentagone (sum of angles: 540°) in the middle
    - Angles of the pentagone (108°) form a complementary angle with the triangle's 2 equal angles. Therefore they are 72°.
    
## Common student mistakes:

- Check semi-colons
- Check case (penup != penUp)
- Check parentheses
- Check structure of classes/method blocks { }
